title: TAS for VMs v6.0 Release notes
owner: Release Engineering
---

These are the release notes for <%= vars.app_runtime_first %> <%= vars.v_major_version %>.

<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> is certified by the Cloud Foundry Foundation for 2023.

For more information about the Cloud Foundry Certified Provider Program, see [How Do I Become a Certified
Provider?](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/certified-platforms-how-to/) on the Cloud Foundry website.

Because VMware uses the Percona Distribution for MySQL, expect a time lag between Oracle releasing a MySQL patch and VMware releasing
<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> containing that patch.

* **[Breaking Change]** No longer install cflinuxfs3 by default
* **[Breaking Change]** Replace cpu entitlement counters with cpu_entitlement percentage gauge
* **[Breaking Change]** Remove (deprecated) Metrics Agent and Metrics Discovery Release
* **[Breaking Change]**: Move and adapt UAA password complexity policies 
* **[Breaking Change]**: Remove ability of UAA to serve as a native SAML identity provider (operators can continue to configure UAA to connect to an external SAML identity provider, using the **Authentication and Enterprise SSO** pane of the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile configuration)
* **[Breaking Change]** Gorouter's deprecated /varz and /healthz endpoints on port 8080 have been removed
* **[Feature]** New form option and migration to opt-into allowing Small Footprint TAS to 'full' TAS upgrade.
* **[Feature]** Add support for NTLM authentication in Gorouter
* **[Feature]** CAPI Enable legacy MD5 buildpack paths
* **[Feature]** Adds Diego support for Docker workloads using OCI images
* **[Feature]**: Gorouters can be configured to prefer routing to app instances in the same AZ as the router
* **[Feature]** Operators can now turn off non-TLS load balancer health check endpoints for Gorouter and TCP Router via the "Enable HTTP load balancer health checks" properties in the "Networking" tab
* **[Feature]** dopplers can be scaled to zero
* **[Feature]** Gorouter now supports LB Health Checks over TLS on port 8443
* **[Feature]** Operators can set the property "Maximum number of network policies per app source" in the "App Developer Controls"
* **[Feature]** CF API now includes routability status from App Readiness checks in the /processes/:id/stats endpoint.
* **[Feature]** Expose a custom environment identifier on component logs forwarded via syslog
* **[Feature]** Advanced Configuration: Do not deploy Diego cells
* **[Feature Improvement]** Make database "encrypt key" setting more intentional, to avoid password-manager autofilling of the field

* **[Feature Improvement]** [Cloud Controller] Add option to configure Instance File Descriptor Limit
* **[Feature Improvement]** Apps using readiness health checks will now see audit.app.process.notready and audit.app.process.ready events reported to `cf events`
* **[Feature Improvement]** Garden now emits an `UnkillableContainers` metric to help identify cells that will be unable to redeploy successfully without operator intervention
* **[Feature Improvement]** Adds opt-in support for NTLM + other challenge-response based authentication using `Authorization: Negotiate` flows by automatically enabling sticky sessions for those requests.
* **[Feature Improvement]** Adds support for `Partitioned` cookies to allow for sticky sessions in embedded contexts.

## <a id='new-features'></a> New features in <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> <%= vars.v_major_version %>

These are the new features for <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> <%= vars.v_major_version %>.

### Reduced logging and metric infrastructure requirements

If you do not use the legacy V1 and V2 Loggregator Firehoses, you now can scale Doppler and Traffic Controller VMs down to zero. This can
significantly reduce costs or free up resources for running additional workloads on the platform.
You might not be able to scale down to zero if you use integrations or other features that depend on the Firehose, such as log and metric nozzles or
Metric Registrar.

### Reintroduction of global log rate limit

<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> v3.0 introduced granular app log rate limits for fine-grained control over application log rates.

<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> v4.0 removed the older global log rate limit feature **App log rate limit (deprecated)** under **App Containers**. This was problematic for operators who were performing a jump upgrade to <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> v4.0 (skipping v3.0), as logs
would not be rate limited until application-based log rate limits were applied.

<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> <%= vars.v_major_version %> restores the global log rate limit, so that operators can perform upgrades while retaining log rate limits. Operators
must configure the same setting separately for both <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> and <%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %>.

If you had previously set a global log rate limit, this limit is re-applied following the upgrade to
<%= vars.app_runtime_full %> <%= vars.v_major_version %>.

### App Autoscaler supports scaling on CPU entitlement

<%= vars.app_runtime_full %> <%= vars.v_major_version %> introduces support for autoscaling on CPU entitlement. This
improves App Autoscaler support for scaling on CPU. Previously, App Autoscaler CPU rules could be brittle due to
their dependency on the underlying Diego Cell configuration. With this feature, apps can autoscale on the CPU
entitlement available, calculated appropriately based on the memory allocated.

## <a id='breaking-changes'></a> Breaking changes

These are the breaking changes for <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> <%= vars.v_major_version %>.

### Default stacks no longer include cflinuxfs3

New installations of <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> <%= vars.v_major_version %> no longer default to include cflinuxfs3 in the list of stacks.
Operators can continue to [Cloud Controller](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Service/<%= vars.current_major_version %>/tas-for-vms/config-cloud-controller.html)
to install cflinuxfs3, if desired.

Upgrading an existing foundation to <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> <%= vars.v_major_version %> does not remove cflinuxfs3.
Apps running on cflinuxfs3 continue to run as normal, and developers can continue to push applications using the cflinuxfs3 stack.
However, if operators [remove cflinuxfs3](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Service/<%= vars.current_major_version %>/tas-for-vms/stack-auditor.html)
from an existing foundation,
then cflinuxfs3 is no longer installed when deploying <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>,
unless the default stack list is configured to include cflinuxfs3 (see above).

Support for the cflinuxfs3 stack is deprecated and will be removed in a future release of <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>.
If you have not already, migrate all applications off of cflinuxfs3 and remove the stack from your foundations.

### Absolute CPU Entitlement metrics no longer available

The `absolute_entitlement` and `absolute_usage` metrics are no longer emitted for each container. They are replaced by the `cpu_entitlement`
metric. If you have any dashboards that reference the `absolute_entitlement` and `absolute_usage` metrics, update the dashboards to use the new metric.

Due to the removal of these metrics, the experimental CPU Entitlement Plug-in no longer functions. If you use this plug-in to view
CPU entitlement usage, you can instead view the `cpu_entitlement` metric, for example using the Log Cache cf CLI plug-in.



## Breaking changes for TAS for VMs Ecosystem tiles (including ISV Partner tiles)

If your team is building a tile (integration) to be used with a compatible TAS version, you need to be aware of the following key changes in
TAS 6.0 that might affect these tiles. Depending on the nature of the offering, not all of the changes might be applicable.

Partners who have a pre-release binary agreement on file can test the compatibility of their offering by claiming a TAS 6.0 environment. 
We encourage ecosystem and partner teams to test and declare compatibility with TAS 6.0 in a timely manner so that our mutual customers can have a smooth upgrade experience.

### Gorouter uses port 7070 by default for internal route services instead of a random available port

**Check if your foundation is affected:**

1. SSH into a router VM.
2. Run `lsof -Pi` to find out if port 7070 is being used.
3. Next, check any routers deployed by IST, to find out if they are affected.

If your foundation is affected, use Tanzu Operations Manager to configure use of a different port.

For TAS for VMs, go to the **Networking** tab and scroll down to the **Route Services** section. If route services are enabled, you will see a text box labeled **The port used for internal route services requests**. Set the value to a known available port, or set the value to 0 to allow the operating system to choose an available port at deploy time.

For IST, go to the **Networking** tab and scroll down to the text box labeled **The port used for internal route services requests**. Set the value to a known available port, or set the value to 0 to allow the operating system to choose an available port at deploy time.

## <a id='known-issues'></a> Known issues

Here are the known issues for <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> <%= vars.v_major_version %>.

### Loggregator Agents in other products may log failure when Dopplers are scaled to zero

Service tile products can use Loggregator Agent to egress metrics for service instances. If the Doppler instance group is scaled to zero,
then Loggregator Agent jobs deployed by these products may repeatedly log a failure to connect to Doppler:

```
failed to connect: unable to lookup a log consumer
```
